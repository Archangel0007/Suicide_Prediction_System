# Suicide_Prediction_System
-> This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Reccurent neural network (RNN) model to forecast suicide risk factors based on postd data from reddit .<br/><br/> -> It uses basic concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to clean  and preprocess the dataset and uses this data to train the above mentioned model to predict potential suicidal behavior, aiding in early intervention and support efforts.<br/><br/>
-> This is the architecture of the model being used: <br/> <br/>
